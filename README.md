codeigniter_parentchild
==============

This is a Codeigniter library for populating a tree/list of items based 
on the parent child relationships within a table. It can provide a tree
view with unlimited levels of hierarchy and/or a full path to a given 
item.

Installation/Usage
------------------

Download and drag the Parentchild.php file into your _application/libraries_ 
folder. 

You will then need to load the library in any controller you want to use it in.


Demo/Test Setup
----------

In the package you will find demo/usage code in the controllers and views
folders. There is also a test database sql file included. Setup a database 
and configure CodeIgniter to use the database. Run the sql file to add the 
tables.

Copy the welcome controller and the views to your CodeIgniter installation.

A demo of the test is located here http://www.qcexample.com/ci_parentchild/

The demo code isn't the most beautiful thing you'll ever see but
it will show you how to use the library for some basics.
